### Requirements:

## Creating the Initial Lineup:

1. Create an empty array called musicFestivalLineup.
2. Use an array method to add at least 10 performers to the musicFestivalLineup array.
3. Log the musicFestivalLineup array to the console.


## Modifying the Lineup:

1. Use an array property to find the number of performers in the musicFestivalLineup, and log the result to the console.
2. Use an array method to remove the last performer from the musicFestivalLineup.
3. Log the updated musicFestivalLineup array to the console.
4. Use an array method to add a new surprise performer to the beginning of the musicFestivalLineup.
5. Log the updated musicFestivalLineup array to the console.
6. Use an array method to remove the first performer from the musicFestivalLineup.
7. Log the updated musicFestivalLineup array to the console.


## Headliner Announcement:

1. Create a new array called headliners and add 3 top performers from the musicFestivalLineup using an array method.
2. Log the headliners array to the console.
3. Use an array method to find the index of one of the headliners in the musicFestivalLineup array, and log the index to the console.
4. Use an array method to check if a specific performer is included in the musicFestivalLineup array, and log the result to the console.
5. Use an array method to create a new array called firstSetList that contains the first 4 performers from the musicFestivalLineup array.
6. Log the firstSetList array to the console.


## Final Touches (Bonus):

1. Create a new array called festivalSchedule by concatenating the firstSetList array with the headliners array using the an array method.
2. Log the festivalSchedule array to the console.
3. Use an array method to create a string that represents the festivalSchedule array with each performer separated by a comma and a space (e.g., "Performer 1, Performer 2, Performer 3, ...").
4. Log the resulting string to the console.
5. Optionally, you can add additional array methods or properties to enhance the project, such as reverse(), sort(), or splice().
